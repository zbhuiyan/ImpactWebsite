He doesn&rsquo;t know how he wants to spend his nights because the only activities he knows of in the area are his parents&rsquo; bingo club and children&rsquo;s sports teams. He has some friends still at home, so he doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to go out and meet new people just yet. He wants to establish a life of his own, so although his parents could help him out he wants to find a house all by himself. He has a car, but he needs to get it insured in his name, and he knows very little about what other kinds of insurance he might need. He has a bank, but he&rsquo;s never had a credit card and he has no idea how to build credit.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Stable Sam</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sam is excited to live in the city they&rsquo;ve been getting to know for the last few years. They&rsquo;re a little nervous because they don&rsquo;t really know what they&rsquo;re doing, but at least they have college friends to hang out with. They could use some help finding an apartment and a car, plus insurance is a beast they haven&rsquo;t even begun to think about. They have a bank, and they&rsquo;re going to stick with it because their parents helped them set up the account when they started school. The credit card their parents helped them set up is good enough for now, and they aren&rsquo;t thinking about getting another one. Sam&rsquo;s parents aren&rsquo;t nearby to be helpful, but at least they can couch surf if they need to.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Lonely Lois</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lois is nervously anticipating moving to a brand-new location with which she has no experience whatsoever. She has no support network in her new city, and she doesn&rsquo;t know how to build one. Finding a house has been difficult, she doesn&rsquo;t know whether or not she might need a car, and while she&rsquo;s thought a bit about insurance she&rsquo;s not sure where she should go to get it. She needs a bank, a credit card, and a set of places to hang out.</span></p></body></html>
