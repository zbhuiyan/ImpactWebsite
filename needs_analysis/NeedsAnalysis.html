often have to relocate for work. Sometimes this takes the form of a cross country move, but sometimes a move across the city is also in order to be closer to their workplace. Any relocation can bring challenges, depending on both personal factors and the kind of move. While it is different to move across the country directly after college than it is to return to your hometown after a few years away, both of these scenarios offer challenges. Our app aims to help these young professionals build a new life in their new locale by providing useful information in a streamlined manner.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using data from the user (such as age, previous location, new location, interests, and concerns about their move), the app will offer a variety of information and suggestions about local businesses and services, transit and traffic information, local government information and laws, and much more. A typical home screen might include items such as &nbsp;&ldquo;Have you considered flood insurance? Your new home is in a flood zone&rdquo;, &nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s 3 grocery stores in a two-block radius. Tap to see more&rdquo;, and &ldquo;You&rsquo;re interested in yoga. There are 4 studios offering classes today within a 10 block radius. Tap to read reviews and book a class&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_795ocufg8fmt-0"><li class="c0"><span class="c5">Who matters?</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our focus is on young professionals who may need some help establishing themselves in a new location. There&rsquo;s a lot of support that falls away when you move out of your family home or graduate college. Finding ways to do all of the &ldquo;adult&rdquo; things you may or may not have done before can be daunting, to say the least, especially if you find yourself in a new location. We&rsquo;re looking to help smooth this transition.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, the people who matter are the young professionals we&rsquo;re focused on. There are going to be people with varying levels of experience - some will already be familiar with the town they&rsquo;re moving to; others might have already found apartments for themselves in the past. But there&rsquo;s some gap in their knowledge, which is what we&rsquo;re aiming to fill. Some people will need help finding insurance while others will need help understanding their new town&rsquo;s nightlife. The important thing for us is that there&rsquo;s something directly related to their new location and probable lack of experience that we can help with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_795ocufg8fmt-0"><li class="c0"><span class="c5">How do your prospective users think about this problem/activity?</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c3">The process of moving brings out a variety of emotions ranging from excitement to dread. Two main problems associated with moving from our users perspective are the fact that information is scattered and decentralized, and the antsiness of waiting to settle in. Based on our interviews, our potential users hate the transitionary period where they have no routine, no home, and have a nagging thought in their head that they&rsquo;re forgetting something. One user commented that she does not feel at home until she has her workstation set up. For others, the transition lasts longer and is just as much of an emotional question as it is a logistic one. The problem of transitioning is made worse by the fact that information on moving is so scattered. Users are unaware of any singular source that will solve the issue of moving, and instead they focus on one aspect at a time, such as transferring their mail addresses. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s also important to consider our two types of potential users. The organized users, those who already have a sense of what moving entails and have done their research appreciate the thought of having a centralized list for checking off tasks. Doing so will give them a peace of mind. On the other hand, the less organized and less prepared users like the idea of having something to remind and guide them through the process.</span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_795ocufg8fmt-0"><li class="c0"><span class="c5">What requirements must your solution satisfy?</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c5">What will the impact of a successful solution be?</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">The impact would be an increased ease in transitioning to new locations for young professionals. A successful solution would be able to prevent the issues that are created when important tasks related to moving aren&rsquo;t completed. This should help alleviate some of the stress inherent in a major life change, allowing our users to focus on becoming comfortable in a new area rather than struggling to find important information.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, our users should be able see information that is important to them before they need it, rather than having to hunt it down when a problem arises (knowing about legally mandated insurance, knowing where the nearest ER is, etc).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">What is the problem in brief? </span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c3">Establishing a new life, in a new place, where you might not know anyone or anything, is really hard. The idea for this project is to make that easier, by helping to identify needs and resources to meet those needs. This app might help you:</span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_jq30wjlvsoll-0 start"><li class="c0"><span class="c3">&nbsp;identify what kind/how much insurance you need</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c3">&nbsp;understand the traffic patterns, public transit options, and geography</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Find &nbsp;potential doctors/dentists/other healthcare providers</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c3">identify options for getting the &lsquo;physical stuff&rsquo; of an apartment</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Identify life hacks and time/money saving tricks</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Locate social opportunities and memberships to help you fill your time and make new friends</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Find service providers (like hairdressers and fitness instructors)</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c9">Geographical data, publicly available information (like train schedules), reviews of area businesses and personal data collected from the user (do you want to have a local gym to attend? Do you need a medical specialist, like an allergist? Do you have a car, and if so, do you want to drive to work?) are aggregated and organized to help the user examine a variety of options for a given issue (ex: I need a way to get a work), and even to realize that they might have that need in the first place (ex: huh, I will be working 12 hour days, I guess it might be good to know which grocery stores are open late). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">How will your project change the status quo? For whom? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Our project will streamline the process of moving for young adults living dynamic lives. It will reduce the time to get settled in, reduce the footprint, and increase the efficiency of users. The target user is young and tech savvy.

Sam would be grateful for help in finding a new apartment and car, figuring out their insurance, figuring out which grocery stores nearby are worth visiting, finding a new doctor&rsquo;s or dentist&rsquo;s office, and finding new places to hang out with their new friends. Lois would feel a lot less helpless if she had our application - she would be grateful for our help in finding a house, figuring out the best way to get to and from work, figuring out public transportation in her new city, figuring out all her insurances and utilities, setting up her new house, finding a bank, and finding a social scene. Ideally, our application would help Carl, Sam, and Lois feel less alone when moving to this new place. The new things they have to tackle would seem a lot less daunting.</span></p></body></html>
